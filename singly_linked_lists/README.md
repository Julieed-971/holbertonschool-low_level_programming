##	Objective

The objective of this project is to learn about single linked lists:
- 	When and why using linked lists vs arrays
-	How to build and use linked lists

##	Requirements

-	Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
-   Code must follow the `Betty` style
-   Global variables are not allowed
-	No more than 5 functions per file
-	The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden.
-	All prototypes for functions should be included in our header file `lists.h

##	Mandatory tasks

### 0. Print list

Write a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.

### 1. List length

Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.

### 2. Add node

Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.

### 3. Add node at the end

Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a l`list_t` list.

### 4. Free list

Write a function that frees a `list_t` list.
