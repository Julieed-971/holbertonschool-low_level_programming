## Objective

    Look for the right source of information without too much help
    How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Requirements

    Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
    All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    Code must follow the `Betty` style
    Global variables are not allowed
    No more than 5 functions per file
    The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden.
    All prototypes for functions should be included in our header file `main.h`

## Mandatory tasks

### 0.0

Write a function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.

### 1.1

Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

### 2.10

Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

### 3.11

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index.

### 4.100

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index.

### 5.101

Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
