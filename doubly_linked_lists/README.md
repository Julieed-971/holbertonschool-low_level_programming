## Objective


What is a doubly linked list
How to use doubly linked lists
Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

## Requirements


Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Code must follow the `Betty` style
Global variables are not allowed
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden.
All prototypes for functions should be included in our header file `lists.h`

## Mandatory tasks

### 0. Print list

Write a function that prints all the elements of a `dlistint_t` list.

### 1. List length

Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list.

### 2. Add node

Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `dlistint_t` list.

### 3. Add node at the end

Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `dlistint_t` list.

### 4. Free list

Write a function that frees a `dlistint_t` list.

### 5. Get node at index

Write a function that returns the nth node of a `dlistint_t` linked list.

### 6. Sum list

Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `dlistint_t` linked list.

### 7. Insert at index

Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

### 8. Delete at index

Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
